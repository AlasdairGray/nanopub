		<h3>Introduction</h3>
                A nanopublication is the smallest unit of publishable information and is composed of a single assertion and its provenance metadata. A nanopublication is a schema (defined below) that sits on top of existing semantic web technology. Essentially, a nanopublication augments ordinary linked data with provenance annotations.<BR><BR> 
                    
                Creating a nanopublication requires a one-time effort to model the assertion and provenance as RDF named graphs. After submission to an open, decentralized nanopublication store, the nanopublication will be available both to humans and automated inference and discovery engines. Nanopublications are stand-alone publications, but can also augment traditional research articles.
                    
                This document offers Concept Web Alliance (CWA) recommendations and specifications for composing, implementing, and using nanopublications. It provides definitions, good practices and examples to help data producers author their own nanopublications. Nanopublication infrastructure is administered by the CWA, and is based on open standards. We anticipate the community-driven evolution of nanopublication formats to fit the changing needs of authors and publishers.

		<h3>Why Nanopublications?</h3>
                When serialized in RDF, nanopublications are interoperable and machine readable, and need not be tethered to centralized databases or research articles for their retrieval and use. Individual nanopublications can be cited and their impact tracked, creating incentives compliance with open semantic web standards (interoperability), community annotation, rapid dissemination and automated reasoning. The provenance can help users decide about the trustworthiness of the assertion and it provides a vehicle for fine-grained attribution to authors and institutions with the intention of incentivizing the accessibility and reuse of data. 

                Nanopublications are a natural response to the explosion of high-quality contextual information that overwhelms the capacity of conventional research articles in scholarly communication. With nanopublications, it is possible to disseminate individual data as independent publications with or without an accompanying research article. Nanopublications can be used to expose quantitative and qualitative data, experimental data as well as hypotheses, novel or legacy data and negative data that usually goes unpublished.

		<h3>The OPS Nanopublication Scheme</h3>
                Definitions
The nanopublication schema combines the assertion and its provenance into a single publishable and citable entity. Both the assertion and provenance are RDF graphs. 

An assertion is a minimal unit of thought, expressing a relationship between two concepts (called the Subject and the Object) using a third concept (called the Predicate). The assertion graph of the nanopublication will take the form of one or more semantic triples (subject-predicate-object combinations). Examples... The scope of the assertion is somewhat arbitrary but as a rule of thumb, it can be limited by what exactly that the author would like to be known for. If it is common in your domain to report evidence or error values with your assertion, then they SHOULD be included here otherwise they will appear in the provenance graph. 

Provenance means, ‘how this came to be’ and provenance graph includes statements for metadata such as methods and parameter settings, as well as attribution such as authors, institutions, time-stamps, grants, links to DOIs, URLs. A nanopublication MUST have provenance of the assertion (the subject being the assertion). A nanopublication MAY have provenance of the creation nanopublication (the subject being the nanopublicaiton). The latter case when the authors of the assertion are different than the authors of the nanopublication. Additional metadata can be added to this minimal structure to accommodate an ever-larger range and finer-grained array of evidence factors and attribution.

A third graph, the publicationInfo, contains statements for provenance referring to the creation of the nanopublication (the subject MUST be the nanopublicaiton). In addition to attribution (recommended publication roles…), the publicationInfo graph contains a date/time stamp (using pro).

In order to maintain flexibility we do not express this requirement in OWL. 

The CWA recommended nanopblucation schema is given below and can be linked to at http://nanopub.org/nschema

<section><h3>Integrity Key</h3>
 task force [Alasdair, Paul, Mark]
-- use cases.... why have integrity keys ? 
-- in principle, integrity keys are unique to nanopubs
-- but integrity keys are not a part of the nanopub 
-- keys are organization independent
-- we need to recommend an algorithm (an RDF hasher)

<section><h3>Nanopublication Compliant RDF for Large Data Sets</h3>
Big Data & nanopublication…. [Zuotian, Erik, Alasdair]

<section><h3>Best & Good Practices</h3>
    [everyone.... after we practice some]
How nanopublications relate to traditional publications… 


Immutability & versions & deprecations…
<ul>
    <li> Nanopublications SHOULD be immutable
    <li> immutability applies only to the nanopublication itself and not to resources linked to it... but creators SHOULD choose stable URIs when possible. 
    <li> Versioning: we use prov ‘hasRevision’
    <li> recommendations on deprecations, retraction... ‘hasStatus’ ? 
    <li> use of blank nodes# URIs
    <li> # URIs... best practice for URIs (persistant & registry)   ...nanopub.og...
</ul>

Whenever possible, existing ontologies and URIs should be used in semantic markup of nanopublication information. CWA recommended ontologies are… 

The primary challenge when nanopublishing data is to model the semantics for clarity and keep a clear separation between the actual observations (measurements) from the interpretations (scientific assertions) and mark-up this distinction in as unambiguous way as possible. Other considerations include economization of memory usage, time-efficient querying, and avoidance of logical inconsistencies. 

Nanopublications should present as low a barrier as possible to the exposure of data. Hence nanopublications have a minimal requirement of an assertion and provenance, but are extensible. The basic idea is that a minimal nanopublication can be easily created, but the better the annotation the more likely it is that the nanopublication will be found, used and cited by others. In other words, there is strong incentive for rich annotation, but a low barrier to getting started.

<section><h3>Templates</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>statistical association [LUMC]
        <li>genomic positions [LUMC, Christine-Oliver]
        <li>curation: nextprot [Christine-Oliver]; chemspider [Colin]
        <li>lots of chem-text [Colin]
        <li>landMark [Mark]
    </ul>
</section>

<section><h3>Implementation issues</h3>
•	Repository / Store (e.g., URI control & data linking) [Rob & Marco]
	-- Issuing URIs (DOIs?) ... what do nanopub IDs look like ?
		nanopub.org////nextprot/nanopubID
	-- concept wiki infrastructure
	-- URI creation service (CW) + linking service (Right Field)

•	Registry [Erik, Mark]
	-- nanopu.org is an aggregator of registries like datahub (using “nanopub” tags)
	-- nanopu.org is an instance for exclusive nanopub data (ckan powers data hub)
